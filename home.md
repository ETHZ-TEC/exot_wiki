# App Lib library

Welcome to the Karajan software suite knowledge base. 
The Karajan software suite was build to orchestrate experiments for the evaluation of covert channels in multicore systems[^1][^2][^3].

However, due to its flexible design, the Karajan software suite can orchestrate and conduct many kinds of different experiments, for example side channel explorations, benchmarking of applications or transmission protocols, etc.
